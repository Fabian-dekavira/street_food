         <h5>Hamburger</h5>
         <img src="Popl_burger.jpg">
         <p>The history of the hamburger is contested, and some say it goes back to ancient Rome, but one theory about the invention of the modern hamburger is that it can be ascribed to Charlie Nagreen, later known as 'Hamburger Charlie',
             who in 1885 squashed a beef meatball between slices of bread so his customers could walk around eating.</p>

             <h5>Turkey Burger</h5>
             <img src="Turkey_burger.jpg">
             <p>this is a burger that might not be everyone's first choice, but should definitely be one all burger lovers get to know. Turkey is a delicious, tasty and dry meat
                 that is packed full of flavour, making it a perfect alternative to red meat for a burger patty.</p>

                 <h5>Elk Burger</h5>
                 <img src="burger.jpg">
                 <p>Elk meat, recently rising in popularity because of a certain bow-hunting podcast celebrity, is something Canadians and Scandinavians have been eating for millennia.
                     It makes a mean burger too.</p>

                     <h5>Cheese Burger</h5>
                     <img src="cheeseburger.jpg">
                     <p>The addition of cheese transforms a burger... into a cheeseburger. But all joking aside, it just makes sense to add a layer of cheese to your burger, 
                        whether it's blue cheese or cheddar, you can't go wrong.</p>

                        <h5>Beyond-meat Burger</h5>
                        <img src="beyond meat burger.jpg">
                        <p>making all the headlines for the last few years, the beyond-meat burger has been one of those food
                             innovations that has helped shift the dial on how people perceive plant-based food in general.</p>

                             <h5>Wild Salmon Burger</h5>
                             <img src="salmon_burger.jpg">
                             <p>Of all fish, salmon makes probably the best fish patty for a burger. 
                                The main thing to consider is the source of your salmon. The addition of dill, capers, mayo and ginger takes this burger the highest level.</p>
